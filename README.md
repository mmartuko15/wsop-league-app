# WSOP League Dashboard

A lightweight Streamlit app to publish standings and pools for your invite-only league.
Uses your Excel tracker (`WSOP_League_Tracker_2025-26_v1_1.xlsx`) and renders player-facing tabs.

## Quick start (local)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
Drop the tracker in the same folder or use the file uploader in the sidebar.

## Deploy
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo and deploy on Streamlit Cloud.
- Or run on any server that can run Python 3.11+.
